# Introduction

C++ is a beautiful programming language with much freedom which opens the door for high-performance applications and make C++ the only true programming language for 3D (complex) Game Engines (like Unreal Engine and Unity -> the engine itself is written in C++ but the code you write is C++ there). Also other high-performance applications like big data and deep neural networks are all written in C++ and most likely shipped to python.<br>
But C++ is not as straight forward as other language like Python. C++ has a long history and therefore much legacy code which should be always avoided and modern alternatives used. Best example are the old arrays and the new standard the vectors which are provided by the huge standard library.

C++:
- provides a standard library
- allows meta-programming
- is fully compiled language
- is typesafe
- choose the programming paradigm you want (object-oriented programming, functional, ...)
