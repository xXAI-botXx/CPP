# Vulkan Compute

This document keeps information about using GPUs for computations with Vulkan. Modern GPUs are no longer only used for graphics, but also for pure computation. GPUs most likely lack for single complex computation commands. GPUs have a benefit when using small computation parallel distributed. This is very interesting for artificial intelligence and simulations. To access the GPU you need a API and Vulkan offers you exactly that, called Vulkan Compute and is a sub area of the Vulkan API.
